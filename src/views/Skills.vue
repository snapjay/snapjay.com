                            p My career has primarily focused on font-end development JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  I have also been a product owner, and usability tester so understand the importance of the interface for the end user.

                            p I use rapid prototyping and wire framing. I like code to be efficient and elegant. This means that I can develop complex functionality while maintaining a high user experience.

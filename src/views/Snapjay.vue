    h1 Hey,  It's Dan!
    h2 An experienced front end web developer.
    p I have been building websites for over 15 years. With a background in all aspects, I specialise in front end VueJS development.
    p I believe in attention to detail, prototyping and user testing. I maintain integrity; not blindly write code that can not be rationalised.
    p I understand the balance between maintaining customer experience and business objectives.
    p I am expert in JavaScript and building interfaces that provide optimum user experience without compromising the business rules.
    p I have worked in conjunction with award-winning agencies on projects for Intel, TD Canada Trust, eBay UK, BBC Worldwide, Telus Mobility and more.
